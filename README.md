![Magic Card Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Horizon0156/MagicCardTracker/main/Artwork/banner_small.jpg)

Magic Card Tracker (MCT) is a Progressive Web Application to keep track of your MTG card collection. Card information and prices are loaded from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com), MCT will enrich your collection information and store the data in your browser. Besides the hosting of the application itself, no additional backend services or databases are required. 

_This application was implemented for personal use and is designed to be simple, extendable and lightweight. Actually, I started this project to try out Blazor in spare time and built the features as I needed those to keep track of my cards while getting rid of Excel. Feel free to run this application to track your collection as well, but appreciate that not everything might work as you would have expected it. Neither Wizards nor Scryfall endorsed this application. In case you host MCT and made it available to the public, please have look at the privacy policy and license information and adjust those to your needs. In addition, you are not allowed to drop the disclaimer about Wizards and the usage related to the Fan Content Policy._

## Installation

Magic Card Tracker is a web application developed on top of ASP.NET Core Blazor (Webassembly). The application is also containerized and ships as a lightwight NGINX image that will host the assemblies. Therefore, you have two options to run this application

### .NET CLI / Dev. Container

If you are using Visual Studio Code, [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) will provide you a preconfigred development environment without messing up your host machine. Simply clone the repository into a volume or your computer and open the folder in a container.

Alternatively you can use the [.NET CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to build and serve the application.

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Run Magic Card Tracker from source
```bash
dotnet run --project Sources/MagicCardTracker.Pwa/MagicCardTracker.Pwa.csproj
```
3. Enjoy your instance running on http://localhost:5000 or https://localhost:5001

In case you are planning to develop new features, you can also run the application in `watch` mode. 

### Docker 
Build the image on your own or make use of a pre-build multi architecture image that is pushed to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/Horizon0156/MagicCardTracker/pkgs/container/magic-card-tracker). The image will host the application on port `80`. You might wanna mount a local `appsettings.json` to `/usr/share/nginx/html/appsettings.json` in order to adjust parameter during runtime without building a custom image. 

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mct ghcr.io/horizon0156/magic-card-tracker
```
